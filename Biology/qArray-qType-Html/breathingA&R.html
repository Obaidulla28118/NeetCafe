  {
    question: "¬ª Assertion: The alveoli are the primary sites for the exchange of gases. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Alveoli have thin walls and are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which facilitates efficient gas exchange.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Both Assertion and Reason are false.",
      D: "Assertion is false but Reason is true."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Both Assertion and Reason are true, and the Reason correctly explains the Assertion. Alveoli are indeed the primary sites for gas exchange due to their thin walls and extensive capillary network."
  },
  {
    question: "¬ª Assertion: The diaphragm plays a key role in the process of inspiration. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Contraction of the diaphragm increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, which creates a negative pressure and draws air into the lungs.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",

    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Both Assertion and Reason are true, and the Reason correctly explains the Assertion. The diaphragm's contraction indeed increases thoracic volume and decreases pressure to allow air intake."
  },
  {
    question: "¬ª Assertion: During expiration, the intra-pulmonary pressure increases. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles reduces the thoracic volume, leading to a rise in intra-pulmonary pressure.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
