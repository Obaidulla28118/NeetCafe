const questions = [
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Living organisms have more Ca, Mg, Na in them than inanimate objects. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Living process is a constant effort to prevent falling into non-equilibrium.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "C",
    explanation: "The assertion is true in that living organisms do have more Ca, Mg, and Na compared to inanimate objects. However, the reason is false because the living process's effort to prevent non-equilibrium is not directly related to the assertion about these elements."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Secondary metabolites are produced in small quantities.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Secondary metabolites have no physiological effect on plants.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "C",
    explanation: "Secondary metabolites are indeed produced in small quantities, but they do have physiological effects on plants, such as defense mechanisms against pathogens and herbivores."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Human diet should compulsorily contain glycine, serine, and tyrosine.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized in the human body.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is false but Reason is true.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "C",
    explanation: "The assertion is incorrect as glycine, serine, and tyrosine are non-essential amino acids, meaning they can be synthesized by the body. Essential amino acids, which must be obtained through the diet, cannot be synthesized by the body."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: The amino acid glycine comes under the category of nonessential amino acids.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: This is due to the fact that it cannot be synthesized in the body.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "C",
    explanation: "Glycine is a nonessential amino acid because it can be synthesized by the human body. The reason provided is incorrect."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Amino acids are known as Œ±-amino acids.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Amino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and carboxylic group as substituent on the Œ±-carbon.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Both the assertion and reason are true. Amino acids are indeed known as Œ±-amino acids due to the amino group and carboxylic group being attached to the Œ±-carbon."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Proteins are a heteropolymer.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Dietary proteins are made up of different types of amino acids.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Proteins are heteropolymers because they are composed of different types of amino acids, which fits the given reason."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: The long protein chain folds upon itself like a hollow ball, giving rise to the tertiary structure.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Tertiary structure gives a 3-dimensional view of a protein.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "The assertion is true because the tertiary structure of a protein is indeed formed by the protein chain folding into a 3-dimensional shape. The reason correctly explains this."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Only 20 amino acids are essential amino acids for humans.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: They are essential for human health.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is false but Reason is true.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "D",
    explanation: "The assertion is incorrect as there are 9 essential amino acids for humans, not 20. The reason is true for the correct number of essential amino acids but does not align with the assertion."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Vegetable oils are fats which are present in plant cells in soluble form.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Vegetable oils occur only in cells of the embryo.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "C",
    explanation: "Vegetable oils are indeed fats present in plant cells, but they are not restricted to the cells of the embryo; they are also found in other parts of the plant. The assertion is true but the reason is false."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Palmitic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon.<br> <br>¬ª Reason: Arachidonic acid has 16 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is false but Reason is true.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "D",
    explanation: "Palmitic acid actually has 16 carbon atoms, not 20. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms, not 16. Both statements are incorrect."
