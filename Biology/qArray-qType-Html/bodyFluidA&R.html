    const questions = [
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Heart failure sometimes called congestive heart failure. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Congestion of the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease.",

      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Heart failure, often called congestive heart failure, is indeed characterized by congestion of the lungs among other symptoms."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: RBCs are responsible for transportation of CO2 from tissue to lungs. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Carbonic anhydrase is the fastest catalyst in RBCs.",

      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },

      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Athletes typically have a higher cardiac output during exercise due to their increased stroke volume and heart rate."
  },
  {

      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Humans have a complete double circulation consisting of the pulmonary and systemic circuits."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Right atrio-ventricular valve is called tricuspid valve. <br><br>¬ª Reason: It is formed of three muscular flaps or cusps.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."

    explanation: "The right atrio-ventricular valve, known as the tricuspid valve, has three cusps."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Lymph is a colorless fluid. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Lymph is without most abundant formed elements.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "Lymph is colorless and lacks the most abundant formed elements found in blood."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Erythroblastosis foetalis can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Anti-Rh antibodies will trap the Rh positive RBCs in the mother's blood.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.",
      C: "Assertion is true but Reason is false.",
      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "C",
    explanation: "Anti-Rh antibodies prevent erythroblastosis foetalis by targeting Rh positive cells, but they do not trap them in the mother‚Äôs blood."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Heart failure is the same as cardiac arrest. <br><br>¬ª Reason: In heart failure, the heart stops beating.",

      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "D",
    explanation: "Heart failure and cardiac arrest are different conditions; in heart failure, the heart does not stop beating but fails to pump effectively."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically. <br><br>¬ª Reason: Specialized muscles (Nodal tissue) present within the heart.",

      D: "Both Assertion and Reason are false."
    },
    correct_answer: "A",
    explanation: "The intrinsic regulation of heart activities is due to specialized nodal tissues within the heart."
  },
  {
    question: " ¬ª Assertion: The state of the heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body is known as heart failure. <br><br>¬ª Reason: It is common among women.",
